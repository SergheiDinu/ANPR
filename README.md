# ANPRwithPython
Trying to get a better idea of who’s stealing your car park?

Just want an awesome Computer Vision project to try out using Python?

Well, ANPR might just be the perfect thing for your to try out!
In this tutorial we’ll go through a full blown walkthrough of performing Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using OpenCV and EasyOCR.
We just edge detection and filtering techniques combined with deep learning powered optical character recognition to be able to extract number plate text from images in just 25 minutes.
